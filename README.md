# Small-Projects-about-AI-ML-and-DS
This project aims to code some small projects about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science. These projects could be used to improve our understanding of AI and ML knowledges, and also sharpen our coding skills. They might be also used to prepare interview.

Even machines start learning now, why not hunman beings? So, let's learn together!

## Development Environment
No need to add any word to discuss the importance of development environment. These tools are platforms on which we get our work done. Properly installing and setting these environments could speed up our works.

Please find popular development environment tools for Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Analysis and Data Science in Popular-Open-Source-Distribution-for-Python.md.

## Popular Packages in Python for AI, ML, DS and DA
Python becomes one of the most popular coding languages due to contributions of varieties of packages.

Please find brief descriptions of popular Python packages for Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Analysis and Data Science in Python-Packages-for-ML.md.

-These projects includes my study notes from [Chinahadoop](http://www.chinahadoop.cn/)
